    question: 'How does TharUrja\'s cooling system work without traditional electricity?',
    answer: 'Our systems use high-efficiency solar panels designed specifically for desert conditions to generate electricity that powers specially designed cooling units. These units are optimized to use minimal energy while providing maximum cooling effect, making them perfect for off-grid applications.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What makes your carbon capture technology suitable for desert regions?',
    answer: 'Unlike traditional carbon capture that requires significant water and energy, our approach uses modified desert-adapted biological systems that thrive in arid conditions. The system captures carbon while using minimal water and can be integrated with local agriculture for additional benefits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How affordable are these systems for rural communities?',
    answer: 'We\'ve designed our systems with affordability as a core principle. We offer flexible community ownership models, microfinancing options, and are working with government subsidies to ensure accessibility. The systems also generate long-term savings by eliminating electricity costs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can your systems be maintained locally without technical expertise?',
    answer: 'Yes, our systems are designed with simplicity and durability in mind. We provide comprehensive training to local community members and use modular components that can be easily replaced. The AI system also helps predict maintenance needs before critical failures occur.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you measure the impact of your technology?',
    answer: 'We track multiple impact metrics including: cooling hours provided, carbon captured (in tons), energy generated and saved, economic benefits to communities, and health improvements. All our systems include monitoring tools that provide transparent impact reporting.',
